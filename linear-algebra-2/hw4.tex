\begin{question}[1]
Prove $\cos(\alpha -\beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)+\sin(\alpha)sin(\beta)$
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
Let $x, y$ be points on the unit circle with coordinates $x = (\cos\beta, sin\beta),\\ y = (\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha)$. Then $||x|| = ||y|| = 1$, and $\angle(x, y) = \alpha-\beta$. Thus, by formula (5),
$$\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)+\sin(\alpha)sin(\beta) = \langle x, y\rangle = ||x||\ ||y||\cos(\alpha-\beta) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos(\alpha-\beta) = \cos(\alpha-\beta)$$
\end{proof}
