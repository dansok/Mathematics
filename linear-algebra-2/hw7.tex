\begin{question}[1]
(a) Let $f(x) = ||x||$. Prove $f$ is continuous with respect to $d(x,y) = ||x-y||$.
\\(b) Let $f: \mathcal{L}(X, U) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(A) = ||A||$. Prove $f$ is continuous with respect to $d(A, B) = ||A-B||$.
\\(c) Prove $f$ defined in $(a)$ is continuous with respect to $d(x,y) = \max_j |x_j - y_j|$.
\\(d) Prove $f$ defined in $(b)$ is continuous with respect to $d(A, B) = \max_{i,j} |A_{i,j}-B_{i,j}|$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
We prove the reverse triangle inequality using the standard triangle inequality for an arbitrary norm first -- $$||y|| = ||x + (y-x)|| \le ||x|| + ||y-x|| \iff ||y|| - ||x|| \le ||y-x|| = ||x-y||$$
Likewise, $\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ||x|| - ||y|| \le ||x-y||$
\\Together, $\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ ||x|| - ||y||\ | \le ||x-y||\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (7.1)$
\\For the first two sections suffices to verify the standard triangle inequality applies, whence $(7.1)$ holds, and continuity follows.
\\$\textbf{(a)}\ ||x-y|| \le \epsilon \implies |f(x)-f(y)| = |\ ||x|| - ||y||\ | \le ||x-y|| \le \epsilon$.
\\$\textbf{(b)}$ By Theorem $(14)(ii)$ in chapter $7$, $||A + B|| \le ||A|| + ||B||$.
\\Thus, $||A-B|| \le \epsilon \implies |f(A)-f(B)| = |\ ||A||-||B||\ | \le ||A-B|| \le \epsilon$
\\$\textbf{(c)}$ Let $i$ be such that $|x_i - y_i| = \max_j |x_j - y_j|$. Let $k, \ell$ be such that $|x_k| = \max_j|x_j|,\\|y_\ell| = \max_j|y_j|$, and WLOG suppose $|x_k| \ge |y_\ell|$. Suppose $|x_i - y_i| = \max_j |x_j - y_j| \le \epsilon$. Then, $$|f(x)-f(y)| = |\ |x_k| - |y_\ell| \ | = |x_k| - |y_\ell| \le |x_k| - |y_k| =$$ $$|\ |x_k| - |y_k| \ | \le |x_k - y_k| \le |x_i - y_i| \le \epsilon$$
\\$\textbf{(d)}$ Let $p, q$ be such that $|A_{p, q} - B_{p, q}| = \max_{i, j} |A_{i, j} - B_{i, j}|$. Let $(k, \ell), (s, t)$ be such that $|A_{k, \ell}| = \max_{i, j}|A_{i,j}|, |B_{s, t}| = \max_{i, j}|B_{i, j}|$, and WLOG suppose $|A_{k, \ell}| \ge |B_{s, t}|$. Suppose $|A_{p, q} - B_{p, q}| = \max_{i, j} |A_{i, j} - B_{i, j}| \le \epsilon$. Then, $$|f(A)-f(B)| = |\ |A_{k, \ell}| - |B_{s, t}| \ | = |A_{k, \ell}| - |B_{s, t}| \le |A_{k, \ell}| - |B_{k, \ell}| =$$ $$|\ |A_{k, \ell}| - |B_{k, \ell}| \ | \le |A_{k, \ell} - B_{k, \ell}| \le |A_{p, q} - B_{p, q}| \le \epsilon$$
\end{proof}
