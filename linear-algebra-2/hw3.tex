\begin{question}[1]
Prove the minimal polynomial of the $n \times n$ matrix $A$, $m_A$, must include all distinct eigenvalues of $A$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
$(\lambda, v)$ an eigen-pair of $A \implies m(\lambda)v = m(A)v = 0 \cdot v = 0$, since $A^k v = \lambda^k v$. Since $v \ne 0$, it follows that $m(\lambda) = 0$.
\end{proof}
