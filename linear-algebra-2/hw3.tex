\begin{question}[1]
Prove the minimal polynomial of the $n \times n$ matrix $A$, $m_A$, must include all distinct eigenvalues of $A$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
$(\lambda, v)$ an eigen-pair of $A \implies m(\lambda)v = m(A)v = 0 \cdot v = 0$, since $A^k v = \lambda^k v$. Since $v \ne 0$, it follows that $m(\lambda) = 0$.
\end{proof}
\begin{question}[2]
Given that the distinct roots of $m_A$ are the distinct eigenvalues of the $n \times n$ matrix $A$, show $-$
\\(a) $d_j \le m_j$ where $m_j$ is the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $a_j$, and $d_j$ is the multiplicity of $a_j$ as a root of  $m_A$.
\\(b) $d_j$ is the index of the eigenvalue $a_j$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
(a) Suppose $d_j > m_j$. Then $(t - a_j)^{d_j} \nmid (t - a_j)^{m_j}$. Thus $m_A \nmid p_A$, a contradiction.
\\(b) Let $m_A(t) = \prod_j(t-a_j)^{d_j}$,  let $p_A(t) = \prod_j(t-a_j)^{m_j}$,  and define $N_j := N_{(A-a_jI)^{m_j}}$. Then $(t-a_i)^{m_i}$ and $(t-a_j)^{m_j}$ are coprime for $i \ne j$, and by the Spectral Theorem, $\mathbb{C}^n = N_0 = N_{p_A(A)} = \bigoplus_j N_j$. Thus $0_{n \times n} = m_A(A) \iff \forall j, \ 0 = m_A(A) \restriction_{N_j} = (A - a_jI)^{d_j} \restriction_{N_j} \iff (A - a_jI)^{d_j} = 0 \iff d_j$ is the index of the eigenvalue $a_j$, as the minimal power such that $(A - a_jI)^{d_j} = 0$, satisfying the minimality requirement of the degree of $m_A$, as the minimal polynomial.
\end{proof}
