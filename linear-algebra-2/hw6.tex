\begin{question}[1]
Prove there exists a unique polynomial $q$ such that $A^{-1} = q(A)$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $A$ is invertible. Let $m_A(t) = \sum_{i = 0}^k c_i \cdot t^i$ be the minimal polynomial of $A$. Then,
$$m_A(A) = A^k + c_{k-1} A^{k-1} + \ldots + c_1 A + c_0 I = 0$$
If $c_0 = 0$, then it follows
$$A(A^{k-1} + c_{k-1}A^{k-2} + \ldots + c_1 I) = 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$
Setting $s(A) = A^{k-1} + c_{k-1}A^{k-2} + \ldots + c_1 I$, we have $s(A) \ne 0$, since $\deg s < \deg m_A$. By $(1)$, $A$ can be column reduced to $0_{n \times n}$, implying $A$ is not invertible, a contradiction. So $c_0 \ne 0$. Now,
$$0 = m_A(A) = A^k + c_{k-1} A^{k-1} + \ldots + c_1 A + c_0 I $$
$$\iff -c_0 I = A(A^{k-1} + c_{k-1}A^{k-2} + \ldots + c_1 I) = (A^{k-1} + c_{k-1}A^{k-2} + \ldots + c_1 I)A\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$
Set $$q(A) = -\frac{1}{c_0} s(A) = -\frac{1}{c_0} (A^{k-1} + c_{k-1}A^{k-2} + \ldots + c_1 I)$$
By $(2)$, we see that
$$q(A) \cdot A = I = A \cdot q(A)$$
Thus $q(A) = A^{-1}$.
\end{proof}
